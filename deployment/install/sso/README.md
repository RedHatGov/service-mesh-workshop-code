# Auth via SSO
Login, registration, and role-based authorization is handled via Red Hat SSO (aka Keycloak).
SSO is included as part of OpenShift or any middleware product subscription you have from Red Hat - woot!

## Installation
We can install via Operator into OpenShift. (You can also choose to do this in whatever namespace you want).

### Install the Operator
* As admin, Goto the OpenShift webconsole and Operators > OperatorHub
* Filter by keyword "Keycloak" and you should see a community operator show up - Click it.
* The details will slide in from the right, Click Install (we are using version 8.0.2 today, higher should be OK too)
* Wait until everything finishes and the operator is running

### Create an Instance of SSO / Configuration
You can do this CLI or webconsole. If using web console just use the + button at the top then drag'n'drop the file from the steps below.

Create Keycloak Instance
* oc apply -f ./keycloak.yaml

Note: your admin username is `admin` and the password is autogenerated. These are in a secret called: `credential-shared-keycloak`

We configure via Kubernetes resources to create the realm, clients, users, and roles as follows:
* oc apply -f ./keycloak-realm.yaml
* oc apply -f ./keycloak-client-app.yaml
* oc apply -f ./keycloak-user-1.yaml
* oc apply -f ./keycloak-user-2.yaml
